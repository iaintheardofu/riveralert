# RiverAlert: Executive Summary

## Preventing the Next Kerrville

On July 4, 2025, the Guadalupe River at Kerrville rose 26 feet in 45 minutes, killing 135 people including 37 children. Despite 22 National Weather Service alerts, **Kerr County never activated wireless emergency alerts**, and the emergency operations center was unstaffed during critical hours. This represents America's deadliest inland flooding since 1976 — a tragedy that modern technology should have prevented.

RiverAlert transforms flood response from reactive to predictive, delivering life-saving alerts in under 60 seconds through a comprehensive platform that integrates IoT sensors, AI risk assessment, and multi-channel notifications. Where current systems fail due to fragmentation and manual processes, RiverAlert succeeds through automation and intelligence.

## The Solution

**RiverAlert** is a real-time flood intelligence platform that bridges critical gaps in emergency warning systems:

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** 30-second data updates from IoT sensors, USGS, and NOAA sources
- **Intelligent Alerts:** AI-powered risk scoring that reduces false positives while ensuring no threat goes undetected
- **Safe Navigation:** Automatic rerouting through Google Maps and Waze integration
- **Universal Access:** Push notifications, SMS, voice calls, web dashboard, and API webhooks
- **Community Engagement:** Crowdsourced validation and bilingual support

## Bexar County Pilot

We propose a 12-month pilot deployment featuring:
- 10 solar-powered water level sensors at critical low-water crossings
- Integration with existing HALT system and NextGen infrastructure
- Direct connection to emergency operations and school transportation systems
- Expected coverage of 100,000+ residents in flood-prone areas
- Training for 100+ officials and first responders

## Investment & Returns
