- **Multi-channel alerts:** Push, SMS, voice, web, API
- **Safe navigation:** Google Maps and Waze integration
- **Community engagement:** Bilingual support and crowdsourced validation

### Investment
- **Funding Request:** $200,000
- **ROI:** 17.9x in Year 1, 62.6x over 5 years
- **Lives Protected:** Zero fatalities at monitored crossings
- **Response Time:** From 20+ minutes to <60 seconds
