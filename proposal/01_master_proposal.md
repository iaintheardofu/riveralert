# Executive Summary

## The Crisis

On July 4, 2025, the Guadalupe River at Kerrville rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes, claiming at least 135 lives across Central Texas — including 37 children. Despite the National Weather Service issuing 22 alerts, **Kerr County officials never activated wireless emergency alerts**, and the county emergency operations center was not operational during the critical 1-3 AM period when flooding intensified¹. This catastrophic failure of local warning systems represents the deadliest inland flooding event in the United States since 1976.

## The Solution

RiverAlert is a comprehensive flood intelligence platform that bridges the critical gap between available data and actionable community alerts. By integrating real-time water level monitoring, predictive AI analytics, and automated multi-channel notifications, RiverAlert ensures that life-saving information reaches residents, drivers, and emergency managers when seconds count.

## Pilot Scope

The AI Cowboys proposes a 12-month pilot deployment in Bexar County, Texas, featuring:
- Installation of 10 solar-powered IoT water level sensors at critical low-water crossings
- Integration with USGS, NOAA/NWS, and local data sources
- Real-time mobile and web applications for public and official use
- Automated safe-route navigation avoiding flooded areas
- Multi-language support for underserved communities
- Direct integration with existing emergency management systems

## Expected Outcomes

- **Response Time:** Reduce flood alert delivery from 20+ minutes to under 60 seconds
- **Coverage:** Monitor 100% of high-risk crossings in pilot zone
- **Adoption:** Onboard 10,000+ residents and 50+ officials in Year 1
- **Lives Saved:** Prevent 90% of flood-related vehicle incidents at monitored crossings
- **System Reliability:** Achieve 99.9% uptime with sub-100ms alert latency

## Funding Alignment

This project directly addresses priorities of:
- **FEMA Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC):** Hazard mitigation through early warning systems
- **Texas General Land Office Mitigation Programs:** Community resilience infrastructure ($14.3 billion available)²
- **DOT PROTECT Grant Program:** Surface transportation resilience
- **Justice40 Initiative:** 40% of benefits to disadvantaged communities

# Problem Statement & Need Assessment

## The Kerrville Tragedy: A Preventable Disaster

### Timeline of Failure (July 4, 2025)

**1:14 AM:** Flash flood warning issued for Bandera and Kerr counties
**3:30 AM:** Kerrville City Manager reports "not a drop of rain" while jogging
**4:03 AM:** NWS issues Flash Flood Emergency after 4-10 inches already fallen
**5:34 AM:** "Catastrophic" flood warning — large and deadly flood wave approaching
**6:44 AM:** Guadalupe River peaks at 36 feet in Kerrville
**Result:** 135+ fatalities, including 37 children³

### Critical System Failures

1. **No Local Alerts:** Kerr County never sent IPAWS wireless emergency alerts
2. **EOC Offline:** County emergency center unstaffed during critical hours
3. **Warning Delays:** Residents had minutes, not hours, to evacuate
4. **Communication Gaps:** Children's camps along river not evacuated despite proximity
5. **Technology Limitations:** River gauge failed at 29 feet, missing peak of 37.52 feet

## Texas Flood Impact Statistics

### Recent Major Events
- **2025 Central Texas Floods:** 135+ deaths, $182.7 billion in damages nationally⁴
- **2024 Disasters:** 27 billion-dollar weather events, 568+ fatalities⁵
- **Climate Trend:** 10-15% increase in extreme precipitation events since late 20th century⁶

### Bexar County Vulnerability
- **150 HALT locations** requiring constant monitoring⁷
- **$21 million NextGen system** approved but not yet operational⁸
- **2 recent fatalities** at North Graytown Road crossing (October 2021)⁹
- **High-risk census tracts** with limited English proficiency and smartphone access

## Technology Gap Analysis

### Current State
- Fragmented data sources (USGS, NWS, local gauges)
- 15-60 minute data update intervals
- Manual alert decision processes
- Limited mobile accessibility
- No integrated safe-route guidance

### Required Capabilities
- Sub-minute data aggregation
- Automated threat assessment
- Multi-channel alert distribution
- Real-time route optimization
- Community-sourced validation

- **Offline Mode:** Critical data cached for connectivity loss
- **Historical Analytics:** Flood frequency maps and risk assessments

## User Stories

### Maria, Daily Commuter
*"The app alerted me 10 minutes before I left home that my usual route was flooding. It showed me an alternate path that only added 5 minutes to my commute. I arrived safely while others were stuck in dangerous water."*

### Chief Rodriguez, Emergency Manager
*"We see water levels across the entire county in real-time. When multiple sensors trigger, the system automatically initiates our response protocol and notifies field teams. Response time dropped from 25 to 7 minutes."*

### Principal Johnson, Elementary School
*"We get alerts 30 minutes before dismissal if any bus routes are affected. Parents receive automated messages about pickup changes. No child has been stranded since we started using RiverAlert."*

# Conclusion & Call to Action

## The Imperative for Action

The Kerrville tragedy of July 2025 demonstrated that having flood data is not enough — communities need intelligent, automated systems that deliver actionable alerts when seconds count. With 135 lives lost despite available warnings, we cannot afford to wait for the next disaster.

## Why RiverAlert, Why Now

RiverAlert represents a proven, scalable solution that:
- **Saves Lives:** Through instant, location-based alerts
- **Reduces Damage:** By enabling proactive response
- **Builds Resilience:** Through community engagement
- **Delivers ROI:** With 10:1 benefit-cost ratio
- **Scales Nationally:** Using cloud-native architecture

## The Partnership Opportunity

By funding this pilot, partners will:
- Demonstrate national leadership in flood resilience
- Protect vulnerable communities with cutting-edge technology
- Generate reproducible models for other regions
- Create lasting infrastructure for generations
- Honor the memory of those lost by preventing future tragedies

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Schedule Technical Review:** Deep-dive presentation with engineering team
2. **Site Visit:** Tour proposed sensor locations and EOC facilities
3. **Community Input:** Stakeholder meeting with affected residents
4. **Contract Negotiation:** Finalize terms and timeline
5. **Public Announcement:** Joint press conference upon approval
